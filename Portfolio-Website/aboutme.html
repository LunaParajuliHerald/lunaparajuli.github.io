        <h1>Little about me:</h1>
        <p> Hi I am Luna Parajuli and I am 20 years old. My birth date is on 9th Feb and I'm an Aquarious 
            and this is a very random picture of my sign. This is my very first time trying to make a website and 
            I have to say i really enjoyed this task. I want to learn more and improve. I love cooking, playing and roaming.
            I am currently living in Kathmandu, Nepal and I am pursuing my bachelors degree here.
        </p>
